An sblg blog theme
==================

I created my [blog](https://reykfloeter.com) with OpenBSD httpd, sblg,
lowdown, and a Makefile. See the article 
[Blog about my Blog](https://reykfloeter.com/posts/blog-about-my-blog)
for more information.

Examples
--------

The posts are written in Markdown with a few lines of metadata
`Subject`, `From`, `Date`, and `Author`.  See the following
[example](https://reykfloeter.com/posts/blog-about-my-blog.md).
